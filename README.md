This data analysis project is designed to assist an online sports clothing company particularly with increasing its revenue by making comparisons between sportswear products of Adidas and Nike brands. It also aims at looking into the total volume of products and median revenue between clothing and footwear.

Given that sports clothing is a giant sector by its own, worth nearly $193 billion in 2021, also having strong growth predictions on its side for the next decade, this analysis highlights the importance of continously paying close attention to the growing data that the online firm maintains to grow the business.


### Data Sources

There were four fundamental datasets harnessed for this analysis:

- brands.csv
- finance.csv
- info.csv
- reviews.csv
  

### Tools

- [Anaconda Navigator: ](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
  - To access the Jupyter Notebook for **Python**


### Data Preparation

No data preparation tasks were required as all the data provided had already been cleaned out prior.



### Exploratory Data Analysis

By analysing all the four datasets, EDA sought to answer the following key questions:

1. What is the volume of products and average revenue for Adidas and Nike products based upon listing price quartiles classified by four pre-determined tags (e.g., Budget, Elite)?
2. Do there any differences exist between the word count of a product's description and its mean rating?
3. How does the volume of products and median revenue vary between clothing and footwear?


### Data Analysis

```python

```

### Findings

The critical analysis results are summarised as follows:

1. The online shop has produced the highest mean revenue via **Adidas Elite** items also by selling those products that are 50% higher than the average number of products being sold.
2. All Adidas products have experienced a four-and-a-half fold increase in mean revenue compared to its Nike counterparts.
3. It was also interesting to note that the higher description length a product has, the higher online rating it has been given by customers.
4. 


### Recommendations



### Limitations

The accuracy of the findings and effectiveness of the proposed suggestions are inherently limited by the quality of the datasets provided.
